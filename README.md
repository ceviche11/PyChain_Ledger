# PyChain_Ledger

## In this assignment, I was able to manipulate a Streamlit page in a .py file and run the application from my terminal. I created many unique transactions in the contents of blocks that were validated through proof of work. I was able to better understand the mechanics of blockchain and "consensus" protocols that validate blocks on the chain. Streamlit allows me to customize a web app using python code, and this use-case is just one example of how I can utilize this tool. 

Attached is a picture of my Streamlit application after running my .py file.
